# tree-sitter-teal

It's a tree-sitter parser for Teal™

Teal is a typed dialect of Lua, [get it here](https://github.com/teal-language/tl)

# Help/Contributions appreciated

All I really know is that tree-sitter is used for things like syntax highlighting. If someone has an Atom or Neovim or whatever example of this that they get working, I'd love to hear about it. And if there are any changes that can be made to make this easier to work with, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
